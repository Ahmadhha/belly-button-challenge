UTOR Challenge 14

## Belly Button Biodiversity

#### Published Dashboard: https://ahmadhha.github.io/belly-button-challenge/Code/index.html

### Background

An interative exploration of the Belly Button Biodiversity Porject dataset. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

### Data Source

Online JSON file: https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json

### Project Scope

Creation of an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset linked to an external site, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dashboard updates via dropdown list selection, and includes three components:

1. Horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in the selected individual.

2. Bubble chart that displays each sample data.

3. Table with sample metadata and paired key.
